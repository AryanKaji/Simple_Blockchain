# Simple Blockchain in C++

This is a basic blockchain implementation in C++ that demonstrates core blockchain concepts such as mining, proof-of-work, hashing with SHA-256, and block linking.

## Features

- SHA-256 hashing using OpenSSL
- Block mining with proof-of-work (adjustable difficulty)
- Each block can hold up to 3 user-defined transactions
- Automatic timestamping
- Genesis block initialization
- Simple console-based user interface

## Requirements

- C++11 or later
- OpenSSL library
